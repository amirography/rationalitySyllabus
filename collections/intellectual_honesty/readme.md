# Intellectual Humility

Intellectual Humility is the virtue of behaving and believing in such a way is epistemically justified.

## The Goal

The goal of this module is in to understand how to suit your behavior, in such a way that it corresponds to the strength of your reasons for that belief.
This will help you to act in such a way that invites constructive criticism, improved persuasion and motivation to improve your own shortcoming.

A person in search for rationality harbours intellectual humility in order to have a self-directed attitude towards critical-thinking.

## Resource

The main resource for this module Church's "Intellectual Humility: an introduction the philosophy and science".

## Sub-modules

### Theory

#### Exercise

1. Find an example of these three in the last week of your life:

- An action risen from intellectual in-humility in which you were over-confident in your beliefs.
- An action risen from intellectual in-humility in which you were under-confident in your beliefs.
- An action risen from intellectual humility.

2. Write a 50-100 words description of why you think each example falls into that category.

3. present that example for others.

#### Resources

The resource for this section are these chapters from Church's book:

1. _Chapter 1 - What is intellectual humility? (and Why should we care?)_
2. `OPTIONAL` _Chapter 2 - What is an intellectual virtue?_
   We mostly care about the first chapter. The second chapter is optional for those who want to have a more rigorous analysis of intellectual humility.

### Becoming Intellectually Humble

In this section we have a brief descriptive analysis of how people usually become intellectually humble. This is necessary in order to draw some intellectual humility.

#### Exercise

1. Think of an intellectually humble person you have access to.
2. Contact them and ask them how they became this way.
3. Whenever you get an answer, write a 100-150 word reflection on that answer.
4. Present that reflection.

#### Resources

The resource for this section are these chapters from Church's book:

1. _Chapter 4 - How do we become intellectually humble?_
2. `OPTIONAL` _Chapter 7 - How do emotions affect our ability to be intellectually humble_

### Can we Believe what we hear?

#### Exercise

1. Find a particularly strong belief of yours (What you believe is an strong and stable view that you hold).
2. List as many as possible testimonies that your belief relies upon.
3. Choose the weakest 5 and figure out how they might have gone wrong.
4. Choose one of the previous 5, and see if it in-fact has gone wrong.

#### Resources

The resource for this section are these chapters from Church's book:

1. _Chapter 8 - Can you believe what you hear?_

### Handling disagreement

#### Exercise

1. Get into a disagreement (preferably one that has already risen before).
