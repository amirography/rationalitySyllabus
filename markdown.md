# Markdown

Markdown is a way to write something and format it. Think of markdown, like Microsoft word's `.docx` format, but much much better. The file extension is `.md` instead of `.docx`.

## Why should I learn markdown?

Think of every time that you had to make a text in a word document, bold, and it ended up looking weird. Think of every time that you had to read a `.docx` file, and had to download a couple of GBs of Microsoft softwares, install them, and ended up looking at something that was dissimilar to what anyone else could read. In markdown, you don't have to deal with that bullshit.

Markdown is like a `.txt`. So almost anything can open it. And there are apps and softwares that can make them look better.

Actually the notes that you are reading is in the markdown format.So for example if I want to make a text bold, I don't have to find the bold button, select my text, hit the bold button and hope the gods of word document that the bold button works and there is no weird formatting conflicts going back there.
Instead I just put `**` on both sides of the words I want to make bold. For example `**This is a bold text**` will look like this: **This is a bold text**.

## How to learn Markdown

Because markdown is extremely popular, there are endless resources to learn markdown. I will give introduce some examples, but you can just search `markdown tutorial` in any language you like, and there will be a ton of articles about it.

## What software/apps should I use

Literally any text editor will work. (including Microsoft notepad). But here is my recommendation:

### For Microsoft Windows/mac/Linux (PC / laptop):

1. For a few files, try [typora](https://typora.io/).
2. If you are planning to take notes in your computer, smartphone or anything like that, try [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

### For android:

1. For a few files, try [Markor](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.gsantner.markor&hl=en&gl=US). It will look ugly, but has a lot of powerful features.
2. If you are planning to take notes in your computer, smartphone or anything like that, try [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

### For iOS:

I'm not familiar with Apple's ecosystem. But I know [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) has an iPhone app.
