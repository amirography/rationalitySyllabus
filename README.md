# Rationality: A syllabus

This repository is intended as a sort of syllabus/reading guide for a group effort of Noumena group (located at [Noumena](t.me/noumena_gr)) to learn to be more rational.


## Instructions

These sessions are going be made up of some modules. Each module contains it's own set of topics, resources and exercises. Let's call them **collections**. Each collection will have a folder and subfolder on it's own. They will be organized _per topic_, and not chronologically. 

So for example, when you want to learn about the definition of rationality you can just look at the files, locate `collections` folder, and find `what_is_rationality` folder. Related files will be under there:

```
.
├── collections
│   ├── ethics
│   ├── intellectual_honesty
│   ├── intellectual_humility
│   ├── living_rationally
│   ├── logic
│   └── what_is_rationality <~ You want to go here 
│       └── readme.md
├── LICENSE
├── markdown.md
└── README.md <~ You are here!
```

For each session the collection(s) used will be mentioned in telegram chat group.
