# Rationality: A syllabus

This repository is intended as a sort of syllabus/reading guide for a group effort of Noumena group (located at [Noumena](t.me/noumena_gr)) to learn to be more rational.


## Instructions

These sessions are going be made up of some modules. Each module contains it's own set of topics, resources and exercises. Let's call them **collections**. Each collection will have a folder and subfolder on it's own. They will be organized _per topic_, and not chronologically. 

For each session the collection(s) used will be mentioned in telegram chat group.
